2. Describe contribution

Jinsheng and I discussed the design's highlevel architecture (Such as which file will provide which functions) at first. Then, I designed the state diagrams and block diagrams for the design, while he was still trying to finish Lab 3. After that, I finished implementing the design, and give him more details regarding on block diagram.

3. We meet three times as total. He and I has about 20 text messages exchanges.

4. I helped Jinsheng on his block diagram, since I'm ahead of him by a lot. I also helped debugging his codes.

5. I learned that Jinsheng is a nice person to work with. His temper made him a perfect teammate. His attitude was also fastidious. Even though he did not get the opportunity to contribute a lot in this lab assignment, he definitely wanted to contribute more. However, since I'm ahead of him, and he did not finish lab 3 until Monday, thus, he did not get the opportunity to contribute...

6. Paul Krogmeier's TB helps because it was posted very early. Later on, I created my own.
