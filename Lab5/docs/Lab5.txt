To ensure correct operation, data_ready must remain asserted for 3 clock cycles. With synchronizer, it will be gauranteed that the dr signal is asserted 2 cycles.
Data must remain valid after data_ready is asserted for 2 clock cycle.

How are the image files different?
It looks like to me that if I add the three filtered photos together, I'll get the original photo. Some color (especially bright colors) are missing on the filtered photos.

What is the general syntax for file IO operation:
$fopen(INPUT_FILENAME, "rb") for opening the file
$fscanf(in_file,"%c" , dib_header[0]) for reading the file
fclose(in_file) for closing the file

What are the different format specifies available for use in the fscanf?
%c for capture pixel, a byte, and DIB header information
The general format is: $fscanf(source,"specifies" , destination)
